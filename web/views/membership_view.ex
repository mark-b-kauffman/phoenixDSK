  # Views render templates. They also act as a presentation layer for raw data
  # from the controller, preparing it for use in a template. Functions which
  # perform this transformation should go in a view.
  # As an example, say we have a data structure which represents a user with a
  # first_name field and a last_name field, and in a template, we want to show
  # the user's full name. We could write code in the template to merge those
  # fields into a full name, but the better approach is to write a function in
  # the view to do it for us, then call that function in the template.
  # The result is a cleaner and more legible template.
